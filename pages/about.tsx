      <p className="text-center w-1/2 mx-auto mt-12 text-gray-500">Welcome to PunAPI, your ultimate destination for puns and wordplay! PunAPI is a pun database and API created and maintained by Cary! I have collected puns from all over the web, so you can enjoy a hearty dose of laughter, wit, and clever wordplay all in one place.</p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-center">Why I Created This</h2>
  <p className="text-center mt-4 text-gray-500">
  PunAPI is my passion project. It all began as a hobbyâ€”a way to combine my love for technology and puns. In my free time, I set out to create a platform that could make people smile with wordplay.  </p>
  <p className="text-center mt-4 text-gray-500">
    The internet is full of puns scattered across various websites and forums, but I wanted to create a centralized space where pun enthusiasts could easily find, share, and enjoy puns of all kinds. I envisioned a platform that would make puns more accessible, searchable, and shareable.
